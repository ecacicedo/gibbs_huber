# Huber regression inference and learning rate calibration with Gibbs posterior.
This repository contain R codes to implement the GPC-SA and GPC-WP algorithms as presented in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04845. It also contains the code for Huber regression coefficient estimation using Gibbs posteriors simulated with RW-MH and pCN.

The file functions.R contain all the functions used in the implementation.

The file implementation.R runs the algorithms for calibration and inference.
